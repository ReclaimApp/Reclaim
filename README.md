# Reclaim [ALPHA] :construction:
A hub for your personal data

Reclaim is an open source desktop app for collecting and storing your online information. With Reclaim you can collect your social media data in a few clicks and explore every photo, friend, and interaction from your digital life.

We just recently reached our MVP in development and are working hard to get our first full featured release out to the public!
